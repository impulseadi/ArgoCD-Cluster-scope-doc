Helm chart will be with the application app folder in main folder.
  
k8s-manifest files will be in the application location of the folder like inside bookmyshowapp/ and to run that we can use (  kubectl apply -f . ) .
First install helm chart from helm install commands. First curl command and then chmod then gethelm one then check helm version.
Step 1: Set Up Helm (If Not Installed)
curl -fsSL -o get_helm.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/helm/helm/main/scripts/get-helm-3
chmod 700 get_helm.sh
./get_helm.sh
helm version
To use helm chart we can use commands to first to move all manifests yaml files to templates folder but first create helm chart.
To create chart in root dir with app location create it inside the application folder. - helm create adi-chart.
cd adi-chart.
Go inside templates- rm -rf *
Empty values.yaml.
Place all values there and helm chart manifest files in templates.
Go to location where manifest files are there and then move them like mv deployment.yaml service.yaml bookmyshowapp/templates/
To create helm chart use this command: helm install adi-release --debug --dry-run adi-chart/ -n adi. (add namespace to create in namespace).
This command will help to validate information of manifests yaml files.
helm install adi-release adi-chart/ -n adi -To create the deployment and all, instead of install use upgrade to upgrade the revision.
